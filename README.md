This is a fork of rspc for Spacedrive.

It is not officially supported so I would recommend checking out the [original](https://github.com/oscartbeaumont/rspc) if you want to use it in your own project.

This repo also contains a fork of [`httpz`](https://github.com/oscartbeaumont/httpz) to workaround some downstream dependencies being yanked.
